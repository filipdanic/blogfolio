## Projects I’ve Worked On

I am employed at <a href="https://spicefactory.co/" target="_blank">SpiceFactory. 🌶</a>

With the Spice crew I’ve had a chance to take on many interesting projects. Both for the enterprise and as a way to develop our own products. I’ll only list some of the internal _“special ones”_ here. You can also catch me on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filipdanic" target="_blank">on Twitch,</a> where I occasionally live stream. Past recording are posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClctBvKpOUts0_B_kvooo_w" target="_blank">on YouTube.</a>   

### 🤖 Sava

<a href="https://savabot.com/" target="_blank">Sava</a> is a platform that offers a complete all–in–one solution for conference organizers: schedule editor, interactive chatbot, a native mobile app for Android and iOS, as well as direct access to the API.

This is an ongoing project that started out only as a chatbot for the <a href="https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/" target="_blank">Voxxed Days conference.</a>

### 🛠 KonceptApp

<a href="https://konceptapp.com/" target="_blank">KonceptApp</a> is an app for running usability tests and creating interactive prototypes. It was the first product that I’ve shipped with SpiceFactory.

 It’s was a very interesting projects from start to finish due to the interactive prototype editor that we developed with React and Redux.

### ⚛️ spicy-datatable

The <a href="https://github.com/filipdanic/spicy-datatable" target="_blank">spicy-datatable</a> module is my first OSS project that got some traction. :) It’s a React.js datatable component that includes search, pagination, CSV export, and localization support.

The motivation for creating this module was:

1. Most React datatable components use jQuery for some DOM manipulation dark magic.
2. Others were just too complex for a simple use case or did not have all the features I needed.

_Stay tuned for more. :)_
