## Projects I’ve Worked On

I am employed at <a href="https://spicefactory.co/" target="_blank">SpiceFactory. 🌶</a>

With the Spice crew I’ve had a chance to take on many interesting projects. Both for the enterprise and as a way to develop our own products. I’ll only list some of the _“special ones”_ here.

### 🛠 KonceptApp

<a href="https://konceptapp.com/" target="_blank">KonceptApp</a> is an app for running usability tests and creating interactive prototypes. It was the first product that I’ve shipped with SpiceFactory.

 It’s was a very interesting projects from start to finish due to the interactive prototype editor that we developed with React and Redux.

### 💰 Cognito

<a href="https://cognito.spicefactory.co/" target="_blank">Cognito</a> is a white-label chatbot solution for banks and insurance companies. It’s purpose is to provide the user with 24/7 access to their financial information, automate minor tasks, help them keep an eye on their finances, and provide quick customer support.

For all the technical folks out there, the “keywords” for this project are nlp, machine learning, and conversational UIs.

### 🤖 Sava

<a href="https://savabot.com/" target="_blank">Sava</a> is a platform that offers a complete all–in–one solution for conference organizers: schedule editor, interactive chatbot, a native mobile app for Android and iOS, as well as direct access to the API.

This is an ongoing project that started out only as a chatbot for the <a href="https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/" target="_blank">Voxxed Days conference.</a>

### ⚛️ spicy-datatable

The <a href="https://github.com/filipdanic/spicy-datatable" target="_blank">spicy-datatable</a> module is my first OSS project that got some traction. :) It’s a React.js datatable component that includes search, pagination, CSV export, and localization support.

The motivation for creating this module was:

1. Most React datatable components use jQuery for some DOM manipulation dark magic.
2. Other’s were just too complex for a simple use case or did not have all the features I needed.

_Stay tuned for more. :)_
