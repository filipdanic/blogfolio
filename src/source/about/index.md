## Projects I’ve Worked On

I run my own consulting gig, but really I mostly work at <a href="https://spicefactory.co/" target="_blank" title="SpiceFactory Website">SpiceFactory. 🌶</a>

With the Spice crew I’ve had a chance to take on many interesting projects: from enterprise software to bootstrapping our own products. I’ll only list some of the _“special ones”_ here.

I’ve also had the honor of mentoring others developers at various stages of their careers. Our office is a great, friendly work environment that I’ve helped nurture.

### 🤖 Sava

<a href="https://sava.events/" target="_blank" title="Sava Events Platform">Sava</a> is a platform that offers a complete all-in-one solution for conference organizers: a schedule editor, an interactive chatbot, a native mobile app for Android and iOS, as well as direct access to the API.

This is an ongoing project that started out only as a chatbot for the <a href="https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/" target="_blank" title="Voxxed Days Belgrade">Voxxed Days conference.</a> (Now <a href="https://heapcon.io/" target="_blank" title="Heapcon Conference">Heapcon.</a>)

### 🚨 Z9 Security

Z9 Security provides technology licensing and professional services in the physical security industry. I actively help maintain their web application that has been deployed at a number of Fortune 500 corporations. I’ve also recently taken the role of developing a new cross-platform mobile app. (Built with React Native.)

### 🛠 KonceptApp

<a href="https://konceptapp.com/" target="_blank" title="KonceptApp Website">KonceptApp</a> is an app for running usability tests and creating interactive prototypes. The main selling point is that you can create user tests and gather analytics that are presented as graphs and heatmaps.

It was a very interesting projects from start to finish due to the interactive prototype editor that we developed with React and Redux.
