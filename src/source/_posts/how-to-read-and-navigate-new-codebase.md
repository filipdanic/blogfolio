Are you excited about inheriting an old project? Me neither. Most engineers are not. Especially if ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù is one of the words that pop up in the meeting.

I‚Äôve been maintaining and improving a project that sounds a lot like that. It‚Äôs been a bit frustrating, but it has helped me learn a lot and grow as an engineer. This article is a collection of tips and tricks on how to deal with projects that fit this description.

## Traversing Uncharted Territory

_Let me set the scene. This is a short personal anecdote that will be entertaining to read. It also provides the context for the rest of the article. (You can skip this part [by clicking here.](#How-to-Dive-Into-a-Large-Codebase))_

### Part 1: Problem Setup

Ever read a murder mystery, but instead of solving a murder, the character is fixing a bug? Not so exciting I guess. Anyway, here‚Äôs the scenario for out little detective mystery:

**Context:** You‚Äôre working on a giant monolith app. The tech is somewhat outdated. (New questions stopped appearing on Stack Overflow around 2010.) There‚Äôs also little documentation left by the previous team.

**Task:** The client reported a bug with one of the form components on the interface. We will henceforth call this `Component A`. The client is using Chrome on Windows 10.

**Confusion:** Upon inspection in Chrome on Mac OS, you cannot reproduce the bug. You could also not replicate the bug on your virtual machine. (It works great both on Edge, Chrome, and IE11!)

**To clarify:** The client is not making this up. You refer to their screenshots and also note that the form looks different on their end. (The styles don‚Äôt match.)

How do you tackle this? Working with bugs that are hard to reproduce is a hard time. What‚Äôs the thought process and where do you start looking first?

<div class="alert-box alert-box__info">ü§î Try to think of a couple of possible problems. Let me know if your intuition guessed what the problem was!</div>

### Part 2: Initial Approach

I was lucky to have a colleague who uses Windows. I got them to open the staging app and check it out. And the bug was there in all its glory.

**I found it strange that the bug was not there on the VM. Was the version of Chrome on the VM different?**

I borrowed their computer over lunch. Then, I inspected the generated HTML and JavaScript bundle via Chrome Developer Tools. My findings were surprising. This strange component was not our `Component A`.

Since bundled code is obfuscated it was hard to figure out what I was looking at. But, I was able to eventually find this component. This `Component B` performed the same functionality, but had different styles and behavior.

Knowing the name of the component I fixed the bug ‚Äì that was related to the logic ‚Äì and tested the changes. Sure enough, the component on the screen still had different styles, but the bug had been solved.

### Part 3: Digging Deeper

Yay, bug solved, case closed, right? _Well, not quite._ This is an interesting find and it has to be resolved. Anything else would be dishonest to the client and disrespectful to my craft.

<div class="alert-box alert-box__info">‚ú® Always try to find the root cause of the problem. Try to avoid compromising with a workaround solution.</div>

**Some more context:** These two components are date inputs. (Very specialized to the business process.) They achieve the same result in the end, but the input flows are very different. These components also look strikingly different in their visual style.

My suspicion was that there had to be some sort of `if/else` switch that determines when B is inserted instead of A.

I started looking at the controller that instantiates the component and worked my way up.

I did not find any such logic on my way to the final file. This was a top-level ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù file that registers every component that‚Äôs used in the app.  It imports these components and makes them available to the global namespace. It does this via a `registerImplementation()` method.

At this point, I am a bit fatigued. I had crawled my way up a big dependency graph, but have not found what I was looking for.

Rotten luck, so far.

Now, I‚Äôve seen this ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù file before, but don‚Äôt remember seeing any real logic inside of it.

As expected I did not find any magical `if/else` statement. What I did find was a `registerImplementation()` call for `Component A`, but none for `Component B`.

I read the file line-by-line and towards the bottom of the file, I noticed something I missed earlier. There was a `require` statement for a file called `mobileAppClient`.  In this file was a magical block of code:

```
if (app.getIsMobile()) {
  overrideImplementation(componentA, componentB);
  // ‚Ä¶other code
}
```

This was no doubt the problem. The app would use `Component B` over `Component A` on mobile devices. And I suspected that this magical `getIsMobile()` method was the problem. (Spoiler: Yes, yes it was!)

The implementation was na√Øve. Much like this:

```
function app.getIsMobile() {
  return Modernizer.touchEvents;
}
```

This logic treated every device with a touchscreen as a mobile device. Sure enough, my colleague's laptop did have a touchscreen. And so did the client who reported the bug.

Reimplemented this method in a more sophisticated way solved the bug. Hooray! üéâ üéâ üéâ

## Grasping The Unfamiliar

The hunt for the source of this little bug took around 3 hours.

**The business value was also greater than initially expected. This bugfix solved several other issues the client was having.**

It also lead us to a bigger discussion about the app‚Äôs mobile experience. (Which was in poor state.)

As for me, this experience helped me get a better grasp of the entire system. As I encountered something new or unusual I‚Äôd take a note of it. I was writing a traveler‚Äôs journal of this unfamiliar codebase.

This is why hunting bugs in a large codebase you‚Äôre not familiar with can be summed up as: _‚ÄúSolving a (~~murder~~) mystery in an unfamiliar land.‚Äù_

You first have to get your bearings, chart out the land, and then start gathering clues and cracking the case.

## How to Dive Into a Large Codebase

(I hope you didn‚Äôt skip the anecdote by the way. If you did, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanicFilip" target="_blank" title="Twitter, @DanicFilip">please tell me why.</a>)

Diving into a large codebase, eh? Eventually, you‚Äôll get the hang of it.

But, if you have to do this on a regular basis, how can you get good (and fast!) at doing it? It comes down to a couple of techniques. I call them:

- observing and researching,
- digging,
- breaking,
- time traveling, and
- resting

I know the names are not brilliant, but let‚Äôs see what they bring to the table

### Observing and Researching

The first thing you should do a new project is to spend time using the app in a production environment. Get to know all the features and the business problems the app is solving.

**This step is crucial to understanding the project. Especially if this is a business domain that you are unfamiliar with.**

After that, you should do detailed research to find all the documentation that exists. Take the docs with a grain of salt as they are likely outdated.

Working with someone who has prior experience with this project? Compile a list of questions and ask for help.

### Digging

This series of techniques is out-of-scope for the purposes of this article. I will list the concepts and trust you to do your homework and research the things you‚Äôre not familiar with.

**But, it mostly boils down to using a good editor or IDE and actually using those the features that make that editor awesome.**

<figure class="blog-post-image"><img src="/content/images/2017/dont-dig-with-kids-toys.jpg" alt="Image of children‚Äôs shovels on the beach." /><figcaption>Use better tools. Photo by Efraimstochter via Pixabay.</figcaption></figure>

I use JetBrains WebStorm. (Visual Studio Code is a fine, open-source alternative.) As for you, you should use whatever you like. But bear in mind that some features are a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù, especially when jumping into a large codebase.

I‚Äôd say that these features are:
- `go-to` definition,
- intellisense (or at least some _‚Äúintellisense light‚Äù_),
- structure pop-up,
- jump down the hierarchy, and
- show usage.

These make it easy to navigate any project with speed. They also shine when dealing with a new codebase.

I would also note that using the search feature of your editor can be very powerful when all else fails. Remember to make your queries more precise with regular expressions!

### Breaking

Debuggers and profilers are your friends! These tools are as important as your editor.  Spend time finding the best ones and getting to know them.

Top features I look for:
- breakpoints (duh),
- change code at runtime,
- jump to line,
- performance profiling,
- track scope stack, and
- access values/methods in scope.

It is not uncommon to have several tools that handle these instead of an all-in-one solution. Obviously, this depends on the language, the surrounding ecosystem, and tooling.

### Time Travel

This tip boils down to one simple truth: **`git` is your friend!**

**Scenario:** Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre fixing a complex bug. You‚Äôve found all the important blocks of code, but you have a hard time figuring out how to actually fix the problem. What now?

At this point, you‚Äôll find yourself confused by something specific. This will likely be a block of code that was at some point introduced either as a bug fix or a feature.

Looking at the history of that file will help you better understand how and when this happened.

How you achieve this is up to you. Some prefer to use `git` from their CLI of choice. The obvious* commands here are:
- `git log -p -- path/to/file`
- `git show`
- `git diff`

I prefer to the use the `git` tools built into my IDE. I find that they help save time overall and don‚Äôt require that you remember all the commands and options.

Choose your tools as you see fit. But remember that the end goal is to go back in time. This should be efficient and yield as much useful information as possible.

You‚Äôll first look for the git message and diff. Then try to find something like this:
- The reference to the ticket (bug report or feature request) that was addressed by the commit(s).
- The pull request and any discussion thread that may have existed.
- The test cases that were introduced/modified when the code was introduced.

And (this is somewhat my ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù):

_The rapid `‚Äúhotfixes‚Äù` that were merged to `‚Äúfix minor bugs‚Äù`. These bugs appeared along with the feature._

Not sure what I mean? Tell me if this sounds familiar:

On smaller teams where one individual owns too much of the codebase, you will see these things happen. The developer will commit a major change (new feature). The feature will generally work but soon a set of bug reports comes in from the QA team or stakeholders.

In a race against time to complete their sprint, the developer will then introduce a series of rapid _‚Äúfixes.‚Äù_

These fixes never address the core problem. They instead introduce a solution to cover some edge-cases. If you‚Äôre ever in a situation like this one, consider this:

1. Revert their bug fixes.
2. Try to refactor.
3. If the refactor fails, re-implement the feature from scratch.

This will likely take a lot more time. Communicate what you plan on doing to your project manager and see if it‚Äôs alright to commit that time.

_*A not so obvious command would be something like `git bisect`. My friend Jovan wrote a quick intro for [the Spicefactory blog](https://spicefactory.co/blog/2016/08/26/spicycomic-3-git-bisect/) about this topic._

### Resting

My final tip is this: don‚Äôt overwork yourself and do everything to avoid burnout.

**_Programming is overwhelming._**

New codebases (especially large ones!) are overwhelming. Trying to understand dozens of design decisions from the past is overwhelming.

Are you a junior developer? Then all the new patterns and ~~needless~~ clever abstractions you encounter will probably be overwhelming.

So with that in mind don‚Äôt make things harder for yourself.

Give yourself time to breathe. Don‚Äôt lose sleep over this. Fight your managers if they try to put you in a crunch or assign impossible-to-hit deadlines.


## Final Takeaways

Fatigued by the article or just skipped ahead to see the titles and images? I feel you. Here‚Äôs what you should remember:

1. **Do your homework:** Learn as much as you can about the domain, the business problems, the app architecture, and find all the docs you can.
2. **Gear up:** Use a great IDE/Code editor that will make digging through the code easier.
3. **Debug at runtime:** Set breakpoints at critical sections. Monitor the stack. Follow what‚Äôs happening line-by-line.
4. **Use git history:** Remember to look at how a piece of code has changed over time whenever you are confused as to what it actually does. (Or why it even exists.)
5. **Rest and don‚Äôt be overwhelmed:** Programming is hard. Your job is hard. Don‚Äôt make it harder by being tired and stressed.
