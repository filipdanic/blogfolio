## Meetups

I’ve also had the pleasure of speaking at various local meetups. These include events organized by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SuperAdmins/" target="_blank">Super Admins</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Practical-UX/" target="_blank">Practical UX</a>, and student conferences such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/umrezavanje/" target="_blank">Umrežavanje.</a>

## What You Should Know

1. I usually have a talk ready and rehearsed. But, I do always tailor it to the event.
2. My company is interested in covering travel and logging expenses, especially if this is a possible _“sponsorship oppertunity.”_
3. I am fine with giving my talk for free. Especially for local meetup groups.

## I Expect That…

1. Your conference has a **code of conduct.**
2. **You advocate for diversity.** Both in your choice of speakers and ways of attracting attendees.
3. Let me know of all technical and logistical details a few weeks **in advance.**

## Let’s Have a Great Time

I don’t really care about “speaker packages”, expensive hotels, and fancy diners. More than anything I want to have a great time with the organizers and attendees. Both at and away from the conference.

I want to explore your city. I want to get a feel of the local culture. I want to know _what makes this place – this community – tick._
