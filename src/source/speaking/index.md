title: Speaking
intro: I consider myself an experienced and enthusiastic speaker. I’ve been fortunate enough to speak at events and meetups of various sizes. It is a good oppertunity, I believe, for one to explore their passion with others.

## What You Should Know

1. I usually have a talk ready and rehersed. But, I do always tailor it to the event.

2. My company is interested in covering travel and logging expenses, especially if this is a possible _“sponsorship” oppertunity._

3. I am fine with giving my talk for free. Especially for local meetup groups.

## I Expect That…

1. Your conference has a code of conduct.

2. You advocate for diversity. For both speakers and attendees.

3. Let me know of all technical and logistical details a few weeks in advance.

## Let’s Have a Great Time

I don’t really care about “speaker packages”, expensive hotels, and fancy diners. More than anything I want to have a great time with the organizers and attendees. Both at and away from the conference.

I want to explore your city. I want to get a feel of the local culture. I want to know _what makes this place – this community – tick._
