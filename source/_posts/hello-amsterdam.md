With a global pandemic and all the chaos in the world, 2020 may not have been the best year to move to another country. Yet, here I find myself moving to the Netherlands to join Amazon!

It’s been a relatively fast journey all things considered as time really moved fast once I got the offer. Looking at things as they are right now, it hard for me to believe it’s October already.

With that being said, there are 2 goodbyes and 2 hellos for me to put in writing.

## Goodbye, SpiceFactory!  

It’s been almost 5 years since [Miloš](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miloszikic/) reached out to me via LinkedIn. Back then SpiceFactory was a 4-person company, but it already had the right culture and ambitions.

I’m sad that I’m leaving. It’s a place where my coworkers were honestly my friends. A lot of companies play by the “family gimmick”, but it’s rare for that to be honest.

If you’re looking for a software engineering position in Belgrade, the [careers page](https://spicefactory.co/careers/) has some open positions.

## Hello, Amazon!

Moving from a product agency to one of the largest tech giants on the planet is quite a change. Changing things around like that has usually worked out really well for me, so I’m very excited!

I can’t wait to see things move and operate at Amazon scale. I’ll be on the FinTech team, so I’m sure I’ll be able to peek inside of various organizations within Amazon.
 
I’m sure I’ll get a chance to share the new things I discover and learn with you via this blog.

## Goodbye, Belgrade!

A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d become part of the [brain drain](https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2018/12/25/brain-drain-important-migration-issue-western-balkans/) that Serbia is struggling with. Leaving my hometown is not easy. And it’s harder when you know you’ve left your family and friends in a country that’s [becoming a real dictatorship.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/opinion/the-dictatorship-next-door-why-serbias-regime-threatens-europes-credibility/) 

Voting with my feet is the last resort I can think of. Until we think of something better at least.

## Hello, Amsterdam!

Amsterdam is definitely one of my favorite cities in the world! It made it easier to accept the Amazon offer when I heard that Amsterdam would be my new home.

Since I got here I’ve already traveled over 100km on foot exploring the beautiful parks and calm streets. [Unlike Belgrade,](/2020/less-cars-more-trees) it’s actually really enjoyable to be a pedestrian here.

A funny thing about me though: _I don’t know how to ride a bike!_ 

Of course, I’m learning (a lot of new things) and I can’t wait to share them with you.
