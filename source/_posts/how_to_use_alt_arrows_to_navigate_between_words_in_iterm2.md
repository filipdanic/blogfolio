I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm not much of a terminal power user. I use iTerm2 as my terminal emulator and there are some things I like to customize. And it bugs me how cumbersome it is to enable the ability to switch between words with <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> and <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üí</kbd>.

Apparently, this is actually called _backward-word_ and _forward-word._ You can see your current setup with:

```bash
bindkey -L | grep backward-word
```

And:

```bash
bindkey -L | grep forward-word
```

You might even like the defaults. (I doubt it.) Now, you can manually set the binding keys via the terminal of course, but I don‚Äôt really get how it‚Äôs used and I hate typing out character codes by hand. üôÇ

So instead, I‚Äôm going to document this method that uses the iTerm2 preferences menu ‚Äì for future reference to myself and to others who might have the same problem. (Please note that this is specific to this emulator.)

## How to Configure backward-word and forward-word in iTerm2

First, in iTerm2, go to **Preferences > Profile > Keys**.

Here you need to set your left <kbd>‚å•</kbd> key to act as an _escape character._ Or _Esc+_ as it is written. (See screenshot.)

Then, in your **Key Mappings** on the same screen, we need to redefine the shortcuts for our desired combination.

Find the current shortcut for <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> (or create a new one), with the following settings:

- _Action:_ **Send Escape Sequence**
- _Esc +:_ <kbd>b</kbd>

Find or create a shortcut for <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> as well with:

- _Action:_ **Send Escape Sequence**
- _Esc +:_ <kbd>f</kbd>

And that‚Äôs it, happy hacking! üéâ If you end up having a lot of these presets, it would be a good idea to export and save them somewhere for future use.
