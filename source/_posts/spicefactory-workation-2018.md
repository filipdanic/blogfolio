The [SpiceFactory](https://spicefactory.co/) annual workation is the embodiment of our culture. It‚Äôs more than a company retreat and not just another empty team building project. Once a year we pack our bags, grab our significant others and kids, and go somewhere abroad to live, work, and play. In 2016 it was Belgium, 2017 was Italy, and this year it was Spain ‚Äì the region of Catalonia to be precise.

This is a short ‚Äúmemoir‚Äù and photo blog of the places we visited and the experiences we shared.

## Day 1: Belgrade ‚û° Barcelona ‚û° Mas Grau

Every workation starts at the Nikola Tesla Airport. Preferably at 2 AM because we‚Äôre vampires and love to fly at night. üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Spirits are high, everything is on time, and we‚Äôre ready to hit the skies!

Although we initially arrived at Barcelona Airport, our destination is still an hour away. Once we picked up our rent-a-cars, we were ready to travel to our villa ‚Äì _Mas Grau_ ‚Äì near the sleepy village of Estanyol in [Bescan√≥.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bescan%C3%B3)

I had the pleasure of being the navigator for my good friend and colleague  Branko. Here‚Äôs a photo of our cabin crew.

That‚Äôs me in the purple shirt, with my girlfriend Tea. Branko is holding the camera, and his wife Marina is holding their son Pavlo (or Pablo as he has been referred to during the workation.)

When we finally reached our accommodations, it was really a sight to behold:

The villa isn‚Äôt just pretty. It‚Äôs equipped with a jacuzzi, sauna, turkish bath, pool table, badminton gear, and a swimming pool. Practically designed for relaxation and community-driven fun.

## Day 2: Garrotxa Volcanic Zone Natural Park and Figueres

Starting our workation off with a hike only seems natural at this point. The Garrotxa Park is beautiful and the trail, although challenging at some places, was wonderful. In the belly of the inactive volcano awaits a charming little church and a great photo opportunity!

After the hike, we went to a local restaurant where some of us tried escargot for the first time. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan though! üêå

Afterwards, we set sail for Figueres, the birthplace of Salvador Dal√≠, and home to the Dal√≠ Museum. To put it bluntly, it was as eccentric as I expected.

## Day 3: Chill

The excitement caught up to some of us at this point and we needed to take it easy. While part of the crew went on _yet another_ hike, the rest of us stayed back. We were kicking by the pool and downing some beers.

## Day 4: Girona

Girona is a charming Catalan city with some of the most beautiful streets and churches you‚Äôll ever see.

It‚Äôs no surprise that this town was chosen as the filming spot for the HBO hit series _‚ÄúGame of Thrones.‚Äù_ Some of its iconic locations were used for the city of Braavos and King‚Äôs Landing. In fact, here‚Äôs a side by side comparison.

## Day 5: Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols

Chilling by the pool is one thing. But, chilling on the beautiful Costa Brava is a whole different level. I envy the Guixolense for the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Golden Hour (Photography)">golden hour</a> that they get to enjoy every day.

## Day 6: The Sheep of Siurana

We visited the Mas Marc√® farm and got to learn about the rare Ripollesa sheep and how this family-owned farm makes specialty cheese. And we got to taste all of it! üêë

## Day 7: Platja d'Aro Costa Brava

Originally a small fishing town, Platja d'Aro is now a major resort. Still, it remains fairly untouched and quiet. We got to do some kayaking along this 2km stretch of Costa Brava.

## Day 8: Barcelona

I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt care much for Sagrada Familia or the Gaudi walking tour. I‚Äôm the type of person who likes quiet, charming streets over massively hyped tourist attractions. Barcelona‚Äôs city center is just too much for me.

But there‚Äôs a whole different world outside this busy, noisy area. You know how you sometimes stumble upon a charming coffee shop? Or maybe a beautiful bookstore? Or how you accidentally end up atop of some high hill, just as the most amazing sunset hits your eye?

Once you leave the crowded city center, Barcelona offers so many of those opportunities and these photographs don‚Äôt do it justice.

## Day 9: Biking

Here‚Äôs something you probably didn‚Äôt know ‚Äì I can‚Äôt ride a bike. üö≤ So, how did I, a non-biker, go biking across the Catalonian countryside? Well, I didn‚Äôt! But I walked my away in the blazing hot sun and reached the destination 5 minutes before the other part of the expedition.

(Yes, my route was shorter, but that‚Äôs just a footnote in the history books!)

## Day 10: Shopping!

Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs a couple of good outlet centers near Girona and we just _had_ to visit some! No photos here!

## Day 11: Barcelona ‚û° Belgrade

We got to spend our last day in Barcelona. (Before boarding our flight back home.) We had to split the gang so we could cover more ground. I went along with the group that decided to visit **Museo Picasso.**

> For those who know how to read, I have painted my autobiography.

It‚Äôs one of the best art museums I‚Äôve visited and I can boil it down to two reasons:

1. **The layout** of the museum is designed to tell a story. As you go from room to room, you‚Äôre looking at Picasso‚Äôs work in chronological order and with just enough detail about his life to make everything click.
2. They added an entire section full of artwork from artists who Picasso met and worked with while in Paris.
  - Seeing the work of other artists, who no doubt left their mark of Picasso, promotes a sort of **historical dialog.**
  - It gives you a new way of looking at his work from that period. (And it also helped me discover the brilliant work of [Ramon Casas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Casas))

## Home Sweet Home

When we left Belgrade, the weather was a sunny 26‚ÑÉ. The weather in Catalonia was similar. But when we got back, we were greeted by a chilly 6‚ÑÉ and risk of rain.

But it‚Äôs good to be home. And home is never really the same once you return from somewhere. But it‚Äôs not the places that change. It‚Äôs us.

And that‚Äôs amazing!
